## Abstract <a name="high"></a>
- :computer: **Simulation**: Creating a simulation of a system enables the tuning of control systems without the need for a physical system.
- :trophy: **PID**: In this research, we employ Lagrangian Mechanics to derive a set of equations to simulate an inverted pendulum on a cart. The system consists of a freely-rotating rod attached to a cart, with the rodâ€™s balance achieved through applying the correct forces to the cart. We manually tune the proportional, integral, and derivative gain coefficients of a Proportional Integral Derivative controller (PID) to balance a rod. To further improve PID performance, we can optimize an objective function to find better gain coefficients.

## Analysis <a name="analysis"></a>
- Using Lagrangian Mechanics, we successfully modele the motion of an inverted pendulum on a cart when forces are applied onto the cart, which allow us to simulate the system and develop PID controllers for the system.
- Both manual tuning and optimization-based tuning methods are used, we can use PID coefficients on optimization-based tuning, similar to those yielding positive results from manual tuning as the initial conditions, which facilitates the generation of highly optimized PID controllers.

## TODO <a name="todos"></a>
- [ ] More sophisticated methods like linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and model predictive control (MPC) could have been used, which would allow for swing-up and swing-down of the rod [5].
- [ ] Learning-based controllers such as imitation learning and reinforcement learning can also be tried.
- [x] More accurate physics models can be derived with optimization or learning-based system identification techniques.
- [x] Compare simulation physics with real-life physics.
- [x] Bugs fix
